# Leetcode API

## Description

This project is written in Flask, and is an original API that returns answers to leetcode problems. Currently, a request to the url will return an answer to a random leetcode problem. 

Of course, this API is for educational purposes only, and was created to learn more about API use, and custom API creation and publication. 

Future steps include writing a web scraper to collect all publically available Leetcode answers, and publishing the API on rapidapi.com
